Heya, I'm Ben! I am a computer science student who enjoys playing tabletop and video games, and I aspire to contribute my own work to those genres.

## About Me
I dont know how to open this. I spend most of my free time playing video games, board games, tabletop roleplay games and card games, both alone and with friends. I want to be a game designer because my expereinces with all of these games have created so many special moments in my life and introduced me to so many special people, and I want to be a part of building the worlds that will create those same kinds of experiences for other people. I am a passionate story teller, once I begin recounting something, it's difficult to get me to shut up before I'm finished. I tried to study an English and Creative Wiritng degree, but I gave it up because there was too much English and not enough writing. I want to channel that passion into making games with compelling narratives. I tried to work moving boxes in a warehouse for a year, but it became too intensive on my body and I left that job. In programming, I at least have the comfort of not noticing the irreperable damage being done to my back until it becomes too late.  I love telling jokes and making people laugh and smile (or cringe, as the case may be). In any given situation, I am always on the lookout for anything I can turn into a visual gag, witty pun, or niche reference.
